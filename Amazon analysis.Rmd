#Analysis
#1.Which products have the highest customer satisfaction based on ratings?
```{r}

  summarize(
    average_rating = mean(rating_cleaned),
    total_ratings = sum(rating_count_cleaned)

```
#Top 10 products with the highest customer satisfaction
```{r}
top_10_products <- product_satisfaction %>% 
  top_n(10, average_rating)
top_10_products
```

#2.Analyze the products with the highest discount percentages. 
```{r}
top_discounted_products <- amazon %>%
  select(product_id, product_name, discount_percentage_cleaned) %>%
  arrange(desc(discount_percentage_cleaned)) %>%

```{r}

  summarize(ratings_total = sum(rating_count_cleaned),

#4.Is there a correlation between discounted price and product rating? 
```{r}
correlation <- cor(amazon$discount_percentage_cleaned, amazon$rating_cleaned)
print(paste("Correlation coefficiency:", correlation))

#very weak correlation
#discounted price does not significantly impact customer ratings.

#6.Identifying products with most positive feedback
```{r}

#Identifying products with most negative feedback
```{r}

#6. Determine which products have the highest engagement based on the number of reviews.

```{r}

  group_by(product_id, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(number_of_reviews = n()) %>%
